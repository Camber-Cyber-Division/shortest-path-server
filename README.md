Instructions
------------

1. If you do not already have a github account, create one.
2. Fork this project.
3. Update the LICENSE file with whatever license you prefer.
4. Add a copyright, license, and warranty notice at the top of each source file
   you create.
 * If you use the LICENSE file included, the information you need to include at
   the top of each source file can be found in the *License* section of this
   README. Just change __your-name-here__ to your full name.
5. Develop a solution to the problem described within the *Requirements*
   section in whatever language you prefer. Recommended languages to use will
   be provided with the link to these instructions.
 * You are welcome to research algorithms and solutions online. However, do
   __not__ copy or use anyone else's code. The solution should be developed by
   you in its entirety
 * The reference solution used to test your application has been written in
   unoptimized C.
6. Add any notes regarding your solution to the *Solution Notes* section.
7. Add the build steps to the *Build Instructions* section.
 * Your solution will need to build and run on a x86\_64 system running Debian
   Stable GNU/Linux.
8. Bonus Points: Like you, we are pedantic nerds. Please let us know if you
   find anything during this process or in our instructions that could use
   improvement.
9. Submit a link to your completed solution as well as any questions to
   <rreiher@camber.com>.

Build Instructions
------------------

*Add build instructions here*


Requirements
------------
* The application will take a directed acyclic graph, a starting vertex, and a
  destination vertex and calculate the shortest path from the start to the
  destination
 * The graph will have a single designated entry point
 * The graph will have a single desigated terminal point
 * The graph may contain disjoint subgraphs
* The application will listen and accept connections on TCP 127.0.0.1:7777
* Upon establishing a connection with a client the application will read the
  starting vertex, destination vertex, and graph from the client file
  descriptor in the format specified under the Input section and write the
  shortest path and distance out over the client file descriptor in the format
  specified under the Output section
 * The input format is guaranteed, and therefore, undefined behaviour for
   invalid input is acceptable


Input Format
------------

* The binary input data's endianness is little-endian. If you are developing on
  an x86 system, you do not have to worry about this.
* The binary input data is split into two-byte fields
* Each field is a sixteen bit unsigned integer in the set: {1,2,...,65535}
 * Zero is an invalid input; it can be assumed that no field will be set to 0
* There are no delimiters between the fields
* The first and second bytes of the file represent the entry vertex of the graph
* The third and forth bytes of the file represent the terminal vertex of the graph
* The fifth and sixth bytes represent the number of edges
* The remainder of the file is as described below:
  * Each field is 6 bytes wide and represents a single edge
  * Each edge is directed
  * Each edge field is split into three sub-fields
   * The first two-byte field is the ID of the source vertex of the edge
   * The second two-byte field a ID of the destination vertex of the edge
   * The third two-byte field is the cost to traverse the edge

     0400 0600 0f00
     0600 0500 0600


Output Format
-------------

* The output will written to the client file descriptor as a string in the
  following format:

          start_vertex->vertex->destination_vertex (distance)
* If there is no path from the starting vertex to the destination vertex the
  result should be in the following format:

          No path from 'start_vertex' to 'destination_vertex'


Sample Output Data
------------------

     # Correct output for sample input data above
     1->3->2->5 (20)

     # Correct output for map with no path from start (1) to destination (2)
     No path from '1' to '2'


Testing Instructions
--------------------

There are several `map#.bin` files in the data directory of this project. Each
of these files conforms with the format defined in the Input section. Your
server should be able to handle and solve each one in series. The data can be
sent to your listening server with the following command (via a shell in
Linux):

     time for i in `ls -1 *.bin`
     do
         echo $(cat $i | netcat 127.0.0.1 7777) \
         >> /tmp/shortest-path-output.txt
     done
